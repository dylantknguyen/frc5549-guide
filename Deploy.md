# Deploying (Java)

1. Connect to the radio, which is the white box with velcro attached to it. It acts like a router so you should be able to connect via WiFi, assuming it is on. If that does not work, connect to the RoboRio (grey box) with an ethernet cable.
2. Once you do that, open the command palette in VS Code (Ctrl + P) and select the "deploy code to robot" command. You can view more precise instructions [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/vscode-overview/deploying-robot-code.html#building-and-deploying-robot-code).
3. Open the Driver Station. **Ensure there is no one working on the robot**, call "clear", and click the enable button. Your code should be running. Click the "disable" button (or Backspace) to stop.
